This is an example for a COAST based CORSIKA binary output file 
reader. It explains in 2 steps, how to use the create an executable
to read CORSIKA output and convert it to ASCII (CorsikaReader) or 
ROOT (CorsikaPlotter) file.

The reader is just a simple example which is meant to be modified by the user
to organize the data as he wants. The name of all the variables are available
in the code but for futher details, please refer to the COAST doxygen
documentation which you can generate with a simple "make" in coast/Documentation
and then you can read it with : firefox coast/Documentation/COASTDocumentation/html/index.html

Step 1:
-------

Compile COAST libraries by selecting option "d1" in 'coconut' (other options 
are not important at this stage) and compile CORSIKA a first time.

Step 2:
-------

If you need it, edit CorsikaReader.cc or CorsikaPlotter.cc to do what you want.
Makefile is defined to compile both CorsikaPlotter.cc (with ROOT) and a
simple ASCII output with CorsikaReader.cc by default. If ROOT is not installed
only CorsikaReader will be compiled. You can compile only one using "make 
plotter" or "make reader".

-------

The executable file CorsikaPlotter (or CorsikaReader) is created and you 
can simply use it with :
CorsikaPlotter DATxxxxxx
