NEWS with version CORSIKA 7.74x are
          Update of bernlohr package to version 1.63 
          In Subr. BOX2 erroneously for EPOS and SIBYLL the decay length
          of strange baryons was not calculated, so these particles were
          transported according to their interaction length. This bug is
          now eliminated.
          Bugs in the binning of the longitudinal profile and in counting
          of neutral particles for upward going showers have been
          corrected.
          New monthly SouthPole atmosphere parameters for IceTop (de
          Ridder) are added.
          Corrections to optimize MPI usage with CoREAS.
          Add MWEIC keyword to select one of the weight in MULTITHIN
          with COASTUSERLIB and possibly keep a normal output.
          Improve compatibility between MPI and MULTITHIN.
          Update CONEX to version 7.5 with improved compatibility with
          CORSIKA (same lambda treatment in QGSJETII), same projectile
          selection as in CORSIKA for SIBYLL and bug correction for phi
          direction in preshower interface.
          Update SIBYLL to version 2.3d with corrections 
          changing the pi0 production (and thus the number of muons
          (lower by few %)) and cross-section (change in Xmax
          smaller by few g/cm2).
          Change format for longitudinal energy deposit in vertical 
          option to get correct depth values in the longitudinal profile.
          This may give problems in connection with some long-file reader.
          Make the extended mass range for CONEX+EPOS optional to save memory.
          Add FLUKAINFN and FLUKACERN options to link the FLUKA 2020 packages 
          provided by INFN and by CERN.
          Bug Corrections in CERENKOV option and for UPWARD+CURVED combination
          for vertical showers.
